# Keto Node JS Express Example

This example demonstrates how to integrate a Node.js backend with
[Ory Keto](https://github.com/ory/keto). It models a simple file-storage
service, based on the example from
[Ory Summit 21 Workshop: Design Complex Authorization with Ory Keto](https://github.com/zepatrik/ory-summit21-talk).
